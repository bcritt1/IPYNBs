The first; it's not always clear what modules need to be loaded, so you spend hours running ./configure scripts over and over again waiting for errors and loading the missing modules. Secondly, with many libraries, even when the module is loaded, they are not found either by ./configure or by the compiler/linker. It might be much easier if the standard Red Hat versions could be provided for the basic stuff that is included in default installations of the distro to save the hours or days wasted compiling software.

The basics are well covered with the example scripts you can find around or even in Sherlock's website, but there are many important tuning details that are left out.

But mostly, what frustrates me when using Sherlock is when the system becomes unresponsive due to some user spawning jobs. This happens in two cases, one when a user spawns jobs taking many cores in the head node, causing not only the simplest scripts to plot data to run extremelly slow, but in some cases it also causes the system to be unresponsive (i.e. even typing takes time).

The second way the system becomes unresponsive often is when some users launches many single-core (or node, I'm not sure) jobs on the owners queue. That causes the jobs I submit to our own nodes to take a very long time to go through our queue (which is empty or has plenty of space to run my job). I often schedule work I have to do on Sherlock for early in the morning or late at night to avoid these problems. I'm my opinion both cases are users trying to abuse the system and end up affecting us.

Also, squeue command is very slow. I have worked before on many other clusters with SLURM (some of them much bigger than Sherlock) and I didn't experience this problem with accessing the state of the queue.",Yes,Maybe,More Documentation,,"How to run jobs more efficiently and estimating CPU/RAM requirements with SLURM/sbatch scripts,High Performance Computing  and cluster basics,Other (Please specify)",I feel that many of Sherlock users really don't grasp cluster basics.
